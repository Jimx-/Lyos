    bool "Secure Digital Host Controller Interface support"
    help
      This selects the generic Secure Digital Host Controller Interface.
      It is used by manufacturers such as Texas Instruments(R), Ricoh(R)
      and Toshiba(R). Most controllers found in laptops are of this type.

      If you have a controller with this interface, say Y or M here. You
      also need to enable an appropriate bus interface.

      If unsure, say N.

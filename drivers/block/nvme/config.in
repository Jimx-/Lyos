config BLK_DEV_NVME
    bool "NVM Express block device"
    help
      The NVM Express driver is for solid state drives directly
      connected to the PCI or PCI Express bus.  If you know you
      don't have one of these, it is safe to answer N.
      To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
      module will be called nvme.

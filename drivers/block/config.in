    ---help---
      Say Y here to get to see options for various different block device
      drivers. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

      If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled;
      only do this if you know what you are doing.

config BLK_DEV_RAM_COUNT
    int "Default number of RAM disks"
    default "8"

      The default value is 8 RAM disks.

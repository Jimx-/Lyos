menuconfig HID_DEV
    bool "HID devices"
    default y
    ---help---
      Say Y here to get to see options for various different HID device
      drivers.

if HID_DEV

config KEYBOARD_ATKBD
    tristate "AT keyboard"
    default y
    help
      Say Y here if you want to use a standard AT or PS/2 keyboard. Usually
      you'll need this, unless you have a different type keyboard (USB, ADB
      or other). This also works for AT and PS/2 keyboards connected over a
      PS/2 to serial converter.

      If unsure, say Y.

      drivers.

if HID_DEV

config KEYBOARD_ATKBD
    bool "AT keyboard"
    default y
    help
      Say Y here if you want to use a standard AT or PS/2 keyboard. Usually

      PS/2 to serial converter.

      If unsure, say Y.

    bool "USB HID transport layer"
    default y
    depends on USB
    help
      Say Y here if you want to connect USB keyboards,
      mice, joysticks, graphic tablets, or any other HID based devices
      to your computer via USB, as well as Uninterruptible Power Supply
      (UPS) and monitor control devices.

      If unsure, say Y.

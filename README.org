Lyos is an open source microkernel multitasking operating system, it runs
on 32-bit x86-based PCs. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

** Features
Lyos has many standard features:

- Microkernel
  + Kernel only handles message passing, interrupts and task scheduling, other things like reading/writing files, memory managing and device operations are handled by servers.
  +Servers are single executables(not modules) that are loaded by kernel at boot time, running in user privilege level and their own address space.
- Multitasking
  + BFS scheduler
- Symmetric multiprocessing
- ELF loading
- Interprocess Communication
  + Servers and user programs communicate using fixed length message(40 bytes)
  + Interrupts are converted into messages and sent to userspace servers
  + Unix signals
- Virtual file system
  + Ext2 filesystem support
  + procfs, sysfs...
- Memory management
  + Virtual memory based
  + Higher half kernel
- Userspace
  + Newlib
  + Dash, GNU Binutils, gcc, GNU Bash...
